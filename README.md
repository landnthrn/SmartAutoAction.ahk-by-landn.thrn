# SmartAutoAction.ahk by landn.thrn

A AutoHotKey automation far smarter than just a autorun  
Allowing you to automate any one key software/game action

---

[Download AutoHotKey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com)

---

## IF YOU WANT TO RUN THEM MANUALLY
Double click the `.bat` file to run the `.ahk` script (skips the choose a version window)

---

## IF YOU WANT TO RUN THEM THROUGH THE BUILT-IN UI (Recommended)
*Can also turn them off through the UI*

1. Open your **Documents** folder  
2. Create a folder called **Scripts**  
3. Inside that `Scripts` folder, create another folder called **AutoSmartAction**  
4. Move all the files from this download into the `AutoSmartAction` folder you made  
5. Windows search for **Environment Variables**  
6. Once the *System Properties* window opens, select **Environment Variables**  
7. Under *User Variables*, select **Path** and then **Edit**  
8. Click **New** to add a new path to your User Variables  
9. Paste the path of your `AutoSmartAction` folder you made — it should look like:  
   `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts\AutoSmartAction`
10. Press **OK > OK > OK** to close Environment Variables  
11. Open a **Command Prompt** window and type:  
    `smartautoaction` OR `autoaction`

    This will display the mini UI that you can use to turn the feature on/off from now on

## INFO ABOUT SMART AUTO ACTION

If you're using the **Shift + Q** version you can autorun with `Shift + Q` or `F1 + W`  
If you're using just the smartautorun without the Shift + Q included then you can autorun with just `F1 + W` alone

To automate any other key/action continuously, use `F1 + (any key other than W)`

---

**Autorun is configured to auto sprint, not auto walk**

---

### COMPARISON SPECIFICS

The autorun keybinds `Shift + Q` or `F1 + W` work differently than `F1 + (any key other than W)`:

- Using `Shift + Q` or `F1 + W` won’t be canceled by these keys:  
  `Control, Shift, Caps, Tab, Esc, Alt, A, D, E, F, W, Space, Mouse clicks`  
  They’ll be canceled by **any other keys** *(Using 'S' to cancel is most convenient)*

- Using `F1 + (any key other than W)` will be canceled by **any other key press**

That’s the difference

## Example of How It’s Smarter Than a Regular Autorun .ahk

Say you're breaking down a tree in a survival game, you would use:  
`F1 + Left Mouse Click`
You will automatically keep hitting the tree

Lots of tree logs and sticks fall on the ground:  
`F1 + (whatever the interact/pickup button is in your game)`
You will auto pick up the logs and sticks you’re looking at
