`Use F1 + (any key other than W)` to auto run that key continously until any other key is pressed  

---

### Autorun Specifics:
The autorun keybind works differently than `F1 + any key other than W`  
Using `F1 + W` (forward in games) won't be canceled by these keys:  
`Control, Shift, Caps, Tab, Esc, Alt, A, D, W, Mouse clicks`  
The autorun will be canceled by any other keys  

Autorun is configured to auto sprint, not auto walk  

---

There's an additonal .ahk for the same features except another keybind included which is:  
`Shift + Q` *(activiates the same autorun feature as `F1 + W` does)*
Just as an easier keybind for autorunning  

---

You can choose between them if you'd rather have the `Shift + Q` to autorun and then use `F1 + any key other than W` to repeat another key's action  

---

### Example of How It's Smarter Than a Regular Autorun .ahk:
Say your breaking down a tree in a survival game you can use `F1 + Left Mouse Click`
You will automatically keep hitting the tree  

**Lots of tree logs and sticks fall on the ground:**  
Use `F1 + (whatever the interact/pickup button is in your game)` 
You will auto pick up the logs and sticks your looking at  

---

# Important Note
Use .bat file to run the ahk script *(skips the choose a version window)*

---

# If you want it to start on PC loadup:  

Create a shortcut for the .bat file of your preference *(With `Shift + Q` keybind or without)*  

Right click the shortcut you made and select **Cut**  

Press **Win + R**  

Type **shell:startup** hit enter  

Paste the shortcut in there
