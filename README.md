# SMARTAUTOACTION.AHK BY LANDN.THRN

A AutoHotKey automation far smarter than just a autorun  
Allowing you to automate any one key software/game action

[Download AutoHotKey V2](https://www.autohotkey.com)

## HOW TO LAUNCH THE MINI COMMAND PROMPT UI EASILY:

- Open your **Documents** folder  
- Create a folder called **Scripts**  
- Inside that **Scripts** folder, create another folder called **SmartAutoAction**  
- Move all the files from this download into the **SmartAutoAction** folder you made  
- Windows search for **Environment Variables**  
- Once the **System Properties** window opens, select **Environment Variables**  
- Under **User Variables**, select **Path** and then **Edit**  
- Click **New** to add a new path to your **User Variables**  
- Paste the path of your **SmartAutoAction** folder you made — it should look like:  
  `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Scripts\SmartAutoAction`
- Press **OK > OK > OK** to close **Environment Variables**  
- Open a **Command Prompt** window and type:  
  `autoaction`

This will display the mini UI that you can use to turn the feature on/off, and check status

### COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE REGULAR VERSION & THE `SHIFT + Q` VERSION:

#### DIFFERENCE IN USE:

For both versions you can automate any other key/action continuously, use  
`F1 + (any key other than W, + mouse clicks & buttons)`

As for autorun there's two slightly different versions:

1. If you're using the `Shift + Q` version you can autorun with `Shift + Q` or `F1 + W`  

2. If you're using the other version then you autorun with just `F1 + W`  

*The Shift + Q Version is obvioulsy more convenient for games*

#### DIFFERENCE IN CANCELING AUTORUN:

The autorun keybinds `Shift + Q` or `F1 + W` cancel differently than  
`F1 + (any key other than W + mouse clicks & buttons))`:

1. Using `Shift + Q` or `F1 + W` won’t be canceled by these keys:  
   `Control`, `Shift`, `Caps`, `Tab`, `Esc`, `Alt`, `A`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `W`, `Space`, `Mouse clicks`  

   They’ll be canceled by any other keys (Using `S` to cancel is most convenient)

2. Using `F1 + (any key other than W + mouse clicks & buttons)` will be canceled by any other key press

That’s the difference

*Autorun is configured to auto sprint, not auto walk of course*

### EXAMPLE OF HOW IT’S SMARTER THAN A REGULAR AUTORUN .AHK

Say you're breaking down a tree in a survival game, you would use:  
`F1 + Left Mouse Click`  
You will automatically keep hitting the tree

Lots of tree logs and sticks fall on the ground:  
`F1 + (whatever the interact/pickup button is in your game)`  
You will auto pick up the logs and sticks you’re looking at
